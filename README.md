# EPI-clone

This repository comprises code to reproduce the analysis of the EPI-clone paper. It mainly uses the Seurat object from [figshare](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.24204750.v1) to generate the plots from the paper. Additionally, utility functions are available in the [scripts](scripts) folder. The EPI-clone function within the [scripts](scripts) folder comprises a functionality to identify clones from scDNAm data in the form of a Seurat object.
